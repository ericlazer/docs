# Roadmap

Looking forward, **2025** will focus on expanding our ecosystem, scaling adoption, and bringing Nexio to production. While we have much ahead  that we can't quite yet share, at a high-level some key milestones include:

* **Private Testnet Launch (Early 2025):** Begin early developer onboarding to test, explore, and build on Nexio.
* **Public Testnet Rollout (Q1 2025):** Provide broader access for developers and projects.
* **Tooling and Developer Incentives (Q2â€“Q3):** Launch SDKs, APIs, technical resources, and incentive programs, including grants and hackathons, to attract builders from EVM and Move ecosystems.
* **Mainnet Launch (Q4 2025):** Roll out a production-ready network, enabling real-world applications with unmatched scalability, security, and interoperability.
