# Vision & Mission

At Nexio, we envision a future where Bitcoin fuels an open, inclusive, and decentralized global financial system for everyone. To realize this potential, we are building the infrastructure to transform Bitcoin from a store of value into a foundation for scalable, secure, and interoperable financial innovation.

<Note>
  Our goal is to unlock Bitcoin's full potential as the backbone of an open and inclusive global financial system.
