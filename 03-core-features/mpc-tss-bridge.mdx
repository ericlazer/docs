Beyond performance limitations like constrained throughput, Bitcoin DeFi remains underutilized due to its lack of easy interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems.

This limitation gives rise to several challenges:

1. **Fragmented Liquidity**: Bitcoin’s liquidity is siloed, preventing it from being effectively utilized in broader DeFi applications.
2. **Isolated Application Development**: Developers face significant limitations when building applications that require cross-chain functionality.
3. **Custodial Risks**: Existing cross-chain solutions often rely on centralized intermediaries or custodial bridges.

### Nexio's Solution: The MPC-TSS Bridge

Nexio addresses these issues with its **MPC-TSS Bridge,** which facilitates secure, trust-minimized cross-chain interactions between Bitcoin and other blockchain ecosystems.

The MPC-TSS bridge combines two powerful cryptographic techniques: **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** and **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS):**

* **MPC for Decentralized Key Management:** Cryptographic keys are split into fragments and distributed across multiple participants in the network. This ensures that participants collaboratively generate signatures without reconstructing the full private key, reducing security risks and decentralizing control.
* **TSS for Cross-Chain Interactions:** The bridge facilitates asset transfers between Bitcoin and other ecosystems by signing transactions with distributed keys. This ensures that all interactions are cryptographically secure, trust-minimized, and verifiable.

The result is a highly secure, trust-minimized bridge that enables cross-chain interactions while upholding Nexio’s commitment to decentralization.

### Key Benefits

Combining MPC and TSS is particularly powerful because it combines two powerful techniques to enable decentralized security with efficient cross-chain operations.

The main benefits include:

* **Decentralized Control**: By removing single points of failure, the system reduces risks of hacks or malicious actions.
* **Enhanced Security**: MPC ensures private keys are never fully exposed, safeguarding the network’s overall security.
* **Transparency and Integrity**: Transaction data is stored in Nexio's Data Availability (DA) layer for full transparency and verifiability.
* **Fast Signing and Computation**: The MPC-TSS network enables rapid and secure validation processes to ensure a cross-chain experience that doesn't sacrifice performance.

Developers can use the MPC-TSS bridge to build new cross-chain dApps, increase liquidity, tokenize Bitcoin for use on other chains, facilitate liquidity flows between ecosystems, and more.
