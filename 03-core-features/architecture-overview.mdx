Nexio's key advantages over other BTC DeFi ecosystems stem from its integrated architecture that combines advanced components into a unified system.
## Transaction Flow

The transaction lifecycle follows these key steps:

1. Transactions are submitted to Nexio's Shared Sequencer
2. Data is published to the DA Layer
3. The Move Executor processes transactions through either:
   - EVM Interpreter (for Ethereum-based transactions)
   - MoveVM (for Move-based transactions)
4. State roots are updated and published
5. Two-layer settlement provides both fast finality and Bitcoin-backed security

## Key Components

### 1. Transaction Submission & Sequencing

Transactions are sent to the M1 Sequence**,** a decentralized sequencer that organizes and publishes the data to Nexio's DA layer to ensure data availability for execution and state updates.

We cover this in the [Nexio's Shared Sequencer](/03-core-features/nexios-shared-sequencer) section.

### 2. Execution

Transactions are passed to the Move Executor, where they are interpreted by either the EVM Interpreter (Geth) for Ethereum-based transactions or the MoveVM Interpreter for Move-based transactions.

We cover this in the [Move Executor and MoveVM](/03-core-features/move-executor-and-movevm) section.

### 3. State Root Publication

After processing, the updated state roots are published. This ensures that all validators in the system have access to consistent and up-to-date information.

### 4. Settlement Mechanism

The settlement mechanism incorporates a two-layered finality system, which we cover in [Fast Consensus with Bitcoin-Grade Security](/03-core-features/fast-consensus-with-bitcoin-grade-security)

* **Fast Finality Settlement (FFS):** Consensus is achieved quickly through staked validators.
* **Bitcoin-backed Finality (ZK Proofs):** Transactions are cryptographically anchored to Bitcoin for immutable and trust-minimized security.

### 5. Data Availability and Validation

Transaction data is available and secured on Bitcoin, ensuring transparency and resilience. This is managed through staking and verification contracts that confirm the correctness of state transitions and zk-proofs.
