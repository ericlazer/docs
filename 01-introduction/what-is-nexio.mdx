Nexio is a parallelized Bitcoin rollup that turns BTC into productive capital. We deliver high throughput, low fees, and built-in yield rails to scale Bitcoin DeFi (and other use cases) globally.

Apart from high throughput, Nexio has several other key advantages:

### BTC-Grade Security

Leveraging ZK Finality and Bitcoin anchoring to ensure tamper-proof state transitions and ultimate network reliability.

### Enhanced Developer Flexibility

Utilizing Move's resource-oriented programming model for more secure and enforceable asset management, alongside dual-language compatibility with EVM for seamless dApp migration.

### Predictable Fees

Nexio ensures a consistent and transparent fee structure, avoiding the unpredictability often seen with gas fees on traditional networks. By leveraging an optimized transaction model and cross-chain design, users and developers can rely on predictable costs for transactions and operations, enabling better financial planning and usability.

### Interoperability

Nexio bridges Bitcoin's UTXO model with account-based architectures, enabling smooth integration with other ecosystems like Aptos, Sui, Ethereum, and extending to MoveVm and EVM-compatible blockchains. This allows developers to leverage existing tools, standards, and infrastructure across multiple blockchain environments.

The result is that Nexio provides the infrastructure needed to finally scale Bitcoin DeFi on a global scale.

## Key Milestones

Despite only launching last year, Nexio has achieved several key milestones:

1. Raising \$2.2M in funding
2. Launching an internal testnet
3. Developing the architecture that supports 30,000\+ TPS, as well as both EVM and Move developers
