## What is Nexio?

Nexio is a high-performance Bitcoin scaling solution that combines a parallel execution model (MoveVM + BlockSTM) with a dual-layer finality system to achieve both high throughput (30,000+ TPS) and Bitcoin-backed security.

Nexio allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts in both Move and Solidity, ensuring compatibility with EVM ecosystems while leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity and security.

## Why Bitcoin?

Bitcoin’s market cap has surpassed $2 trillion, yet its functionality remains limited to basic transfers and asset storage.

Nexio unlocks Bitcoin’s full potential by enabling smart contracts, DeFi, and seamless cross-chain interoperability, all while maintaining Bitcoin’s security, decentralization, and trustless nature.

## What is MoveVM, and why does Nexio use it?

Move is a powerful programming language originally developed for Meta’s Diem blockchain, designed with security, scalability, and asset management in mind. It introduces resource-oriented programming, which ensures that digital assets cannot be duplicated or lost, along with formal verification for provable contract safety and parallel execution for high transaction throughput.

The MoveVM is the virtual machine that executes Move smart contracts, bringing these benefits into practice. Nexio leverages MoveVM to provide secure asset management, seamless compatibility with both Move and EVM smart contracts, and the scalability needed for Bitcoin Layer 2 applications.

## Is Nexio Fully Decentralized?

Nexio is designed for progressive decentralization, starting with a decentralized sequencer and MPC-TSS bridge, with plans to distribute governance to the community.

We believe this is the most effective approach to building a strong, sustainable ecosystem.

## How Does Nexio Compare to Ethereum Layer 2s?

Unlike Ethereum L2s that settle on Ethereum, Nexio settles on Bitcoin while maintaining smart contract functionality and high transaction speeds.

## Can Developers Migrate Existing dApps to Nexio?

Yes, Nexio supports EVM-compatible smart contracts, meaning Ethereum developers can deploy Solidity-based applications without changes. Move-based applications can also be deployed seamlessly.
