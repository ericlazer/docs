Nexio eliminates the need for:

1. Cross-chain bridges,
2. Token wrapping, or;
3. Custodial intermediaries.

This is thanks to the MPC-TSS Bridge covered in [MPC-TSS Bridge](/03-core-features/mpc-tss-bridge).

This architecture is highly secure and provides an extensive range of benefits that include decentralized control, strong security, transparency and integrity, and ultra-fast computations.

**In this section, we provide a closer look at:**

* **Threshold-Based Security:** Nexio uses an \{m, n\} threshold configuration to ensure that any transaction requires collaboration from a minimum number of participants.
* **Deposit Flow:** When users deposit Bitcoin into Nexio's MPC-TSS vault, generating cryptographic proofs and minting equivalent BTC tokens for use within Nexio's ecosystem.
* **Withdrawal Flow:** When users withdraw Bitcoin back to the Bitcoin network through a secure process involving proof generation, verification, and decentralized approval using MPC-TSS.
