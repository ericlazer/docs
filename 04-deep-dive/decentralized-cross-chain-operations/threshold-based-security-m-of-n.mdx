title: 'Threshold-Based Security (M of N)'
---

The Nexio bridge operates as an MPC-TSS network-owned vault, utilizing an \{m, n\} threshold configuration. This means that a minimum number of participants (m) out of the total (n) must collaborate to authorize any transaction.

For instance, in a \{51, 100\} setup, at least 51 participants out of the 100 in the network are required to sign and validate a transaction collectively. This decentralized approach enhances security by ensuring no single participant can unilaterally control or compromise the system.

By distributing the signing process across multiple participants, this architecture significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure, aligning with Nexio's commitment to trust-minimized infrastructure.
