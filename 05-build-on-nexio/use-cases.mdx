### 1. Core DeFi Applications

Nexio empowers developers to build and expand classic DeFi use cases on Bitcoin. It's important to keep in mind that although Nexio ties to the Bitcoin network, the MPC-TSS bridge enables secure, trust-minimized interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems.

1. **Lending and Borrowing**: Build protocols where users can lend or borrow assets. For example, BTC could be lent out on Nexio, with assets then borrowed on an EVM network.
2. **Liquidity Provision and Yield Farming**: Assets can be leveraged to find the best cross-chain yield opportunities.
3. **Stablecoin Issuance**: Bitcoin-backed stablecoins anchored directly to the Bitcoin network.
4. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Fully decentralized trading platforms for both Bitcoin-native assets and assets from external networks.

### 2. Enterprise-Grade Solutions

Institutions are increasingly holding more BTC, a trend that will only increase given the recent ETF approvals, a pro-Bitcoin government in the U.S., economic uncertainty, and more.

We are now at a tipping point, and as institutions increasingly hold BTC on their balance sheets and explore potential use cases, the demand for advanced financial tools will continue to grow.

With Nexio, beyond the Core DeFi Applications listed above, developers can build out other applications such as:

* **Enterprise Payment and Treasury Management:** Tools for enterprises to manage Bitcoin holdings, including automated payments, treasury yield optimization, and secure custody solutions.
* **Tokenized Real-World Assets:** Create Bitcoin-backed tokens that represent real-world assets such as real estate, enabling fractional ownership and liquidity.
* **Gaming Economies with Bitcoin Rewards:** Gaming infrastructure where users earn Bitcoin as rewards.
* **Cross-Border Payment Systems:** Fast, low-cost payment systems that leverage Bitcoin's liquidity for fast and reliable international transactions.-border payment systems,

Essentially, anything that an enterprise may wish to use can be built with Nexio, and it's likely that the most impactful use cases are yet to exist.

### 3. SocialFi & GameFi

Nexio provides an ideal foundation for SocialFi and GameFi projects by combining scalability, security, and privacy with financial incentives.

For **SocialFi**, Nexio enables users to tokenize and monetize content like social posts or digital art as NFTs while ensuring ownership and security. Platforms can leverage Nexio’s decentralized governance models for transparent decision-making and reward distribution. Privacy is enhanced through ZkVM, protecting user interactions while allowing public verification. With high transaction throughput, Nexio supports large-scale social interactions seamlessly.

For **GameFi**, Nexio’s high throughput allows real-time gaming interactions like item purchases, in-game currency transfers, and PvP mechanics. Low transaction fees make microtransactions frictionless, and with the MoveVM, developers can create smart contracts to manage true ownership of in-game assets, ensuring players can trade and transfer NFTs with verifiable proof. ZkVM also ensures user privacy in games requiring anonymity, such as decentralized casinos or strategy games.

### **4. New Innovative Applications**

Move’s resource-oriented programming model allows developers to implement more nuanced, enforceable logic around asset flows.

This enables:

* **Complex Escrow Systems**: Automatically enforce conditions for asset release within smart contracts.
* **Modular Governance**: Develop governance frameworks where voting and fund allocation rules are encoded into an asset’s logic.
* **Automated Unlock Conditions**: Implement time-locked or event-triggered asset releases, such as vesting schedules for startups or milestone-based payments in crowdfunding campaigns.

Here are some use cases possible using the above:

1. **Real Estate Tokenization:** Complex escrow systems for real estate transactions, ensuring conditions like inspections or milestone payments are met before releasing funds.
2. **Vesting Contracts for Startups**: Time-locked automated unlock conditions for equity or token vesting schedules tied to employee or founder milestones.
3. **Insurance Claims**: Create smart contracts where payouts are automatically triggered based on event verification (e.g., natural disasters, delays).
4. **Crowdfunding Platforms**: Modular governance to manage funds allocation based on voting outcomes or predefined criteria in a decentralized crowdfunding platform.

### 5. Other Use Cases

The possibilities with Nexio are vast. Given that Bitcoin is becoming the new global financial system, having a platform like Nexio underpinning this new economy provides a foundation for nearly any kind of project.

This might include:

* Rewarding video game players or website traffic with BTC micropayments
* Asset management systems for the [1.4B unbanked](https://digitalfinance.worldbank.org/) people of the world
* Entirely new financial products that are yet to be invented
