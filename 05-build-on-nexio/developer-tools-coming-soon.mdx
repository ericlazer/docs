title: 'Developer Tools: Coming soon'
---
We are actively working on finalizing the Nexio development tools, including SDKs, integration guides, and comprehensive documentation. These resources will become available when our Devnet is launched, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy applications on Nexio.

Stay tuned!

Once the Devnet is live, you will have access to:

* **Nexio SDK:** Tools and libraries to streamline dApp development.
* **Integration Guide:** Step-by-step instructions to integrate with Nexioâ€™s architecture.
* **Smart Contract Development:** Resources to build and deploy smart contracts using the MoveVM.
* **Testing & Deployment Tools:** Simulate and optimize your projects before deploying them on the network.

In the meantime, follow our updates for the latest news on Devnet progress.
