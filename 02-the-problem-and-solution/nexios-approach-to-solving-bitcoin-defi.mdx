title: "Nexio's Approach to Solving Bitcoin DeFi"
---

As covered in the previous section, 5 major limitations are preventing global BTC DeFi growth:

1. **Limited Throughput & Linear Execution**
2. **Centralized Trust**
3. **Poor Developer Experience**
4. **Fragmented Interoperability**

Nexio's **intricate infrastructure** addresses each of these challenges using advanced features like parallel execution, shared decentralized sequencers, and cross-chain interoperability. This enables Bitcoin's potential for global-scale decentralized finance by delivering unparalleled scalability, decentralization, and developer accessibility.

### 1. High Throughput with Parallelized Transaction Execution

Nexio achieves over 30,000 transactions per second by leveraging both **MoveVM** and **BlockSTM**, two advanced parallelized transaction execution systems. These enable the network to process over far exceeding the throughput limitations of Bitcoin's base layer.

* **MoveVM**: Leverages Move's resource-oriented programming model to reduce computational overhead and enable parallel execution of smart contracts. By structuring data more efficiently, MoveVM minimizes bottlenecks, ensuring rapid and scalable transaction processing.
* **BlockSTM**: Enables concurrent execution of transactions by analyzing dependencies and processing independent transactions simultaneously. This parallel approach reduces delays and maximizes throughput, ensuring the network maintains high performance even under heavy load.

Together, MoveVM and BlockSTM form a complementary system that maximizes efficiency and scalability, enabling Nexio to achieve over 30,000 TPS, far exceeding the limitations of Bitcoin's base layer.

Parallel processing boosts performance by enabling multiple transactions to execute concurrently across different nodes, improving throughput, scalability, and reducing network congestion. This strategy optimizes the use of multi-core processors, lowers energy consumption, and ensures the network can handle more transactions without sacrificing security or reliability.

Additionally, Nexio's **fast finality network** (FFS) ensures near-instant confirmation of transactions, minimizing delays and providing a seamless user experience. We cover this in [Fast Consensus with Bitcoin-Grade Security](/03-core-features/fast-consensus-with-bitcoin-grade-security)

<Accordion title="Explainer: Why MoveVM?">
  The Move programming language is exceptionally powerful, designed for creating highly secure and efficient applications. Built on a Rust-based foundation, it features a resource-oriented and modular design that prevents vulnerabilities like double-spending, enabling developers to implement high-performance smart contracts with confidence. This combination of security and efficiency has made Move a leading choice for innovative blockchain protocols.

  Move's growing developer ecosystem reflects its appeal. Currently, Move developers represent 9.7% of monthly blockchain developers, with this figure projected to rise to 14.2% by next year - outpacing the growth of the SVM.

  Its intuitive design attracts talent from JavaScript and Web2 backgrounds, empowering teams to secure funding and build sophisticated projects. This positive feedback loop of innovation and adoption is fueled by Move's ability to combine robust language design with a seamless developer experience.

### 2. Decentralized Trust

Nexio uses the **M1 Decentralized Shared Sequencer**, which operates across multiple rollups, maintaining a unified transaction ordering system that:

* **Eliminates Centralization Risks**: By decentralizing transaction sequencing, Nexio avoids the pitfalls of single-point failures.
* **Guarantees Deterministic Transaction Ordering**: Ensures that transactions are processed in a consistent and conflict-free order, avoiding vulnerabilities caused by reordering or inconsistencies.

Transaction data is also published to the Bitcoin Network for transparency and immutability.

### 3. Great Developer Experience

Nexio's dual-language compatibility supports both Solidity and Move.

This works by having _Fractal,_ Nexio's special code interpreter, convert Solidity code to an intermediate language that contains EVM opcode instructions, which are then mapped to their corresponding Move bytecodes and processed by the MoveVM. We cover this in-depth in [Move Executor and MoveVM](/03-core-features/move-executor-and-movevm)

This makes it very easy for developers from either the Ethereum or Move ecosystems to get started building in the Bitcoin scaling solutions landscape.

In addition, Nexio offers SDKs, APIs, grants, and an active support team dedicated to helping developers build effectively and efficiently. For more information, visit [Developer Tools: Coming Soon](/05-build-on-nexio/developer-tools-coming-soon)

### 4. Unified Liquidity

Nexio overcomes fragmentation issues with its MPC-TSS Bridge, which enables secure, trust-minimized cross-chain interactions between Bitcoin and other blockchain ecosystems.

By leveraging Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), the bridge eliminates the need for centralized custodians, ensuring decentralized and tamper-proof interoperability.

This means that applications built on Nexio can access liquidity not only from the Bitcoin network but also from other EVM and non-EVM ecosystems.
